- 👋 Hi, I’m @crudy002
- 👀 I’m interested in doing cool projects that involve data manipulation, artificial intelligence, IoT in languages like Java and Python. I also generally enjoy the high that comes along with solving complex problem sets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get out of my comfort zone in the stack away from back-end, with web programming, front-end and databases.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is challenging or can help build fondational knowledge in new areas surrounding software.
- 📫 Feel free to email me at christopher.b.ruediger@gmail.com
